Students Grades Prediction ðŸ“š
-
In this project, we developed a machine learning model to predict students' grades based on key features such as study hours, attendance, and prior academic performance.

Key Highlights:
-
Objective: Build a predictive model to estimate students' final grades accurately.

Data Preparation: Ensured the dataset was clean and ready for modeling by handling missing values and scaling features as needed.

Model Development: Implemented and evaluated regression models to predict grades, with a focus on achieving high accuracy.

Tools & Techniques:
-
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.

Machine Learning: Regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, etc.

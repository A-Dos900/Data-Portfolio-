Movies Profits Analysis & Modeling ðŸŽ¥

This project focuses on analyzing movie data to understand key factors that contribute to a movie's profitability. The workflow includes:

Data Cleaning: Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing relationships between columns such as budget, revenue, genres, and runtime using statistical and visualization tools.
Key Insights:

Identified trends and correlations between features like budget and revenue.

Analyzed the impact of genres and runtime on movie success.

Predictive Modeling: Built a machine learning model to predict movie profits based on key factors, using regression techniques.
Tools & Techniques:

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Statistical Analysis: Correlation analysis and feature importance evaluation.

Machine Learning: Regression models for profit prediction.

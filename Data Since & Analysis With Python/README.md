Data Science and Analysis Projects ðŸ“Š

This section of my repository showcases a collection of data science and analysis projects that involve data cleaning, exploration, statistical analysis, and building machine learning models to derive meaningful insights from real-world datasets. Each project demonstrates the use of Python tools and libraries, along with statistical methods, to solve data-driven problems and uncover patterns in the data.

What's Inside? ðŸš€

Data Cleaning: Removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and transforming raw data into a clean and structured format.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using Python and statistics to explore datasets and identify trends, correlations, and patterns.
Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to understand data distributions and relationships.
Machine Learning Models: Building predictive models using libraries like Scikit-learn.
Visualizations: Creating clear and informative charts using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to present findings.


Feel free to explore the projects, review the code, and share your feedback! ðŸŒŸ
